  'All of the information that we obtain, whether it\'s from television or from your phone used to be news but now it\’s opi-news, When reporters, anchors and so-called \'experts\' (3 on the left and 3 on the right) are exchanging words in the discussion table, they’re not necessarily reporting news. I rather label it as opi-news.',
  'Sadly, this occurs over and over again in endless cycles. They do it to sell, make profit and capture viewership. This is called "the law of attraction".',
  'So, what is the long-term effect of too much information? We have to ask ourselves “what is it doing to us?”.',
  'If you don’t read the newspaper, you’re uninformed. If you do read it, you’re misinformed. So, what is the long-term effect of too much information?',

  'The question is: How have you replied politely? Have you perfectly disproved my argument? The answer is: no because you don\'t possess a counter argument. You vilified me instead.',
  'You\'re too focused on how you feel and what you think and that wanders you away from the truth. You are led astray.',
  'The truth is the truth and we must live in the truth. The truth is NOT correlated within our opinionated perspectives.',

  'CNN is worse than Fox News.',
  'Still no change from you, eh. After all of those years.',
  'Evening fellow ice cavers.',
  'Life itself is mysterious.',
  'How did the universe began? How was it formed? How did the process of so called \'evolution\' lead to orderly and organized galaxies, planets, moons, the rotation and circulation of comets.. etc.. Those are questions we can\'t answer with affirmation. That\'s why scientists create hypothesis leading to theories. That\'s the maximum point to what we can believe after spending enormous time and effort in finding the answers to these sorts of questions. ',
  'In response to your reply, we can\'t observe the unseen except if it\'s detectable like oxygen and supposedly \'dark matter\'. This topic is rather a matter of \'if\'. You or even I, or even the smartest scientists out there can not set forward evidence that proves that.',

  'We didn\'t choose to be born. We didn\'t choose our sex or gender. We didn\'t choose who our parents were/are. We didn\'t choose which country we live in. We didn\'t choose to be alive or in existence.',
  'I sometimes ponder and reflect about where I was born, where I was raised and where I currently live and I can\'t be more pleased than how I\'m feeling now regarding that.',
  'However, at times I also do think about how my life would be if I was born, raised or lived in another country, especially in a 3rd world country which is horrendous and it feels as frightening as it sounds, living life without the freedom and values America portrays but I can\'t confirm who I will be, how I will think or what I will do but I\'m sure that my attributes and characterization depending on what country I\'m from will pertain to its culture, politics, religion, environment.. etc.. There is only speculations in dialogues as these that are subjective.',
  'We live in a world that has a population of almost 8 billion people and they all vary from different nations, countries, cultures, genders, religions and so on that influences how they all live, think and interact with others. You have to understand, placeholder, that most people aren\'t in agreement with what/who you think you are and your perspectives and that will never change. ',
  'Face it, some things will indisputably never change in life, no matter how hard people try. There has always been an opposition party. There will always be black and white, hot and cold.. etc...',

  'We live in a dark world where evil will always continue to exist as long as the earth spins.',
  'I\'m sure many people here resemble the same viewpoints as I do and they\'re perhaps too frightened to speak their minds or how they feel about a certain notion due to being backlashed but hey, I\'m not like them.

  'We all go through changes, physically, mentally and psychologically.',
  'At times we choose to change whereas in other circumstances we change without our realization within our subconscious mind.',
  'Will I change? yes but I am cautious to what I will believe in. It depends on whether or not the substance is plausible enough according to my own behaviorism, but.... I can\'t guarantee anything concerning that since anything is possible.',
  'All I can say is that I\'ll be the judge of whatever I\'ll accept as fact or fiction, and with tremendous of outside source of course.',
  'I don\'t detest you, I really don\'t. We merely have contrary perspectives and mindset but that shouldn\'t set us apart. You said you dislike me only because I don\'t have your standpoint. Doesn\'t that sound rubbish to you? I don\'t hate you simply because you don\'t share my beliefs.',
  'That\'s why I cease to resume in this dialectic, it appears to be endless. It doesn\'t seem like we can reach an impasse.',
  'Again, re-read my post if you think I believe that. You\'re being arrogant placeholder.',
  'I recommend everybody to read or re-read the large post I\'ve put out that regards my response to placeholder. I\'m about to rest my case.I recommend everybody to read or re-read the large post I\'ve put out that regards my response to placeholder. I\'m about to rest my case.',

  'You\'re *LITERALLY* putting words in my mouth, that\'s why I advise you to re-read my post.',
  'I respect everybody of all kinds, however I may not view the world the same way they perceive it. That doesn\'t give me the right to mistreat them in a inhumane manner.',
  'That\'s all I\'m going to say, for now.',
  'Please, and please... and seriously... re-read what I\'ve posted.',
  'Nature doesn\'t lie. Sometimes the course, productivity and constant change in nature is the source of our comprehension about the outside world. ',
  'For instance, I\'m 22 and if I were to claim that I am 50 years old simply because I feel like I\'m that age then that should be justified by that concept of yours. This is bogus, it doesn\'t make sense and it doesn\'t set in with reasoning.',
  'Many people dislike me because I speak my mind, but I do so since there\'s freedom of speech and you will not take away that freedom from me.',
  'Enough said, placeholder. Please stop countering his argument.',
  'You don\'t have any idea yet.',

  'damn right placeholder.',
  'Your response is?',
  'Carry on mate.',
  'Why are you switching the topic?',
  'People used to bash at me because I speak my mind. That\'s why you people kept banning me, but guess what? Freedom of speech.',
  'Other than feelings, you\'re not who you think you are',
  'But let me tell you something.',
  'Why express hatred towards me?',
  'I don\'t even know what you look like.',
  'Oh, so that\'s your defensive strategy?',
  'Excuse my language, but I\'m fucking fed up with this world. It\'s literally upside down.',
  'That\'s why I\'m done with society and with people, it\'s due to people like you.',
  'You can\'t say something like that to somebody who is suicidal because if the person does commit suicide, you will regret every sort of maltreatment you\'ve executed towards that person. That makes you look rubbish and cruel. ',

  'I believe you\'re too embarrassed to admit that when you shouldn\'t be.',
  'I think you\'re that, placeholder, and I also think you\'re playing games.',
  'Well, not as much as I used to. I\'ve entered a crisis and it has affected me in every form you can possibly think of. But I\'m still of faith of course.',
  'Those were the days.',
  'I\'m LoW~S~Rick by the way.',
  'It\'s too defiance unto my belief.',
  'I wish I could but I\'m pretty occupied at the moment.',
